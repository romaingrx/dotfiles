# Dotfiles

> My dotfiles for MacOS and Linux mostly using Nix.

>[!Warning]
> At the moment, I'll focus on the MacOS setup and it's a work in progress. It's not very good for multi-user mode in macos as we lack a better way to manage homebrew packages and shared packages.

> [!Note]
> I really recommend using Obsidian to view the documentation as it doesn't appear very well with the github markdown renderer.
