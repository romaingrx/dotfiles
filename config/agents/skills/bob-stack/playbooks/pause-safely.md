# Pause safely

Apply when in-flight work must stop cleanly so it can be resumed: an explicit pause, going offline, or a restart. The complement to `playbooks/session-pickup.md`.

**You own a clean stop. Leave a checkpoint a cold-start agent can resume from.** This is explicit only. On "keep going", "going to bed, keep going", or "don't stop", do not pause.

1. Stop at a safe boundary. Finish the current atomic step or back out of it. Start nothing new, and stop any running subagents.
2. Take no irreversible action to pause. No PR and no push unless you already had one out.
3. Make the work durable. Commit uncommitted edits as one clear `wip:` commit on the current branch so nothing is lost. If the tree is broken, say so in the commit body in one line.
4. Write the resume note off-context, as an untracked file that survives a reboot: `"$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/resume.md"`. Capture intent, what you were doing, progress and what's verified, the exit predicate if one exists, current state, next steps, key files, and gotchas.
5. Name the resume point: the branch, the `wip:` commit SHA, the note path, and the first action on resume.

**Reply:** where you are in the loop, what's on disk versus still in your head (paths, no diff dumps), the commits you made and whether the tree is clean, the resume note path, and the first action on resume. This is a pause, not a final report.
